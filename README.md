## Description

With this project I am creating a web application called Discussion Forum. The application will be a web forum which allows users to submit and respond to threads. I am using Angular and Materialize css for the front end, Node.js with Express.js for the back end scripting, and SQLite for the database.

## Plans

* Allow for users to create an account
* Host the project on a web server
