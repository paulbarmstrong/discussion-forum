## Description

With this project I am creating a web application called Discussion Forum. The application will be a web forum which allows users to submit and respond to threads. So far I am using Angular and Materialize css for the front end, and Node.js with Express.js for the back end.

## Plans

* Host the project on a web server
* Begin storing serverside data in an actual database
* Allow for users to create an account
