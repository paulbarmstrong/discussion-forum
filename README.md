## Description

With this project I am creating a web application called Discussion Forum. The application is a web forum which allows users to create an account and submit and respond to threads. I'm using Angular and Materialize css for the front end, Node.js with Express.js for the back end scripting, and SQLite for the database.

## Usage

The web application is served at [discussion-forum.io](http://discussion-forum.io)
